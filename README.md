# Flashing Tiles

This is an attempt to implement Flashing Tiles experiment to study "Steady State Visual Potential" using Python.

## How the experiment looks like.

The experiment is implemented using [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy). Kivy provides `schedule_interval` that is easier
to implement than Pygame which is used by [gumpy-paradigms](https://github.com/gumpy-bci/gumpy-paradigms) 
and also provide faster update rate. Below are error rates of the frequency of each tile. 

```
On Exit Report
[Tile with 6.00 hz]
[Average Frequency] 5.8857
[Average Absolute Error] 5.84%
[SD of Frequency] 0.01
[Average Absolute FPS] 78.30 fps
[Tile with 6.57 hz]
[Average Frequency] 6.4873
[Average Absolute Error] 2.52%
[SD of Frequency] 0.00
[Average Absolute FPS] 78.33 fps
[Tile with 7.50 hz]
[Average Frequency] 7.6741
[Average Absolute Error] 3.72%
[SD of Frequency] 0.00
[Average Absolute FPS] 78.33 fps
[Tile with 8.57 hz]
[Average Frequency] 8.0253
[Average Absolute Error] 8.44%
[SD of Frequency] 0.01
[Average Absolute FPS] 78.31 fps
```

## Installation

1. use `Python 3.7.2`
2. install `pipenv`
3. install all of dependencies with `pipenv install`
4. enter pipenv environment with `pipenv shell`
5. start the app with `python main.py`


## Config

Look at `config/`, you'll find various config and constant value files.

1. `apprearance.py` will be about general appearance of the app eg. color, whether to show frequency label.
2. `experiment_setup.py` is the main config file. Here you can set
    
    2.1 `scenarios` is where you and new condition for the experiment. Whether to show random word from `word_list`
    and the frequency of random words. `tiles` is where you add a new tile to the condition.
    
    2.2 `break_scenarios` is where you setup what to show during break time between each condition.
    
    2.3 `story_setup` is where you set how the overall experiment is run.
    
    - `enable_random` for showing each condition in random.
    - `scenario_order` is if you want to order which condition to show first based on list indexed of `scenarios`.
    - `scenario_interval` is for setting how long each condition shows.
    - `break_interval` is for setting how long the break interval is.
    - `num_episode` is for setting how many series of experiment will be run. For example, if you put 4 here
    with 3 scenarios, the program will play these 3 scenarios for 4 times.

## TODO

1. Find out how to calibrate frequency
2. Add a config to run multiple experiment in a row
